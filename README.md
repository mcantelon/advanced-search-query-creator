advanced-search-query-creator

(In early development.)

TLDR: jQuery/Backbone implementation of an advanced search query creation form

Allows you to define fields that constitute a search clause so users can
add/remove clauses to define a search. Helper functions can translate the
clauses into URL parameters and URL parameters into search form clauses
upon page reload.

Open demo.html in a web browser to get a quick demo. The logic for the demo is
in demo/demo.js.
